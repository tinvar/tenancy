 *
 * Both fail closed. A walk up from a tenant that loops, or goes deeper than
 * any real hierarchy would, says the tenant is not under the root -- a
 * request refused, never one let in on a tree that does not hold together.
 * A subtree larger than a read can carry is an error rather than a part of
 * one, since a part would be a silently wrong answer.
 *
 * It is the tree tenancy registers with the Orm, as the Orm's
 * TenantSubtrees: an application writes the tree, never the walk. The Orm
 * reads it through TenantBounds, which holds its answers to the same limits
 * again, so they hold for any implementation of the port, this one or an
 * application's own (ADR 0056).
