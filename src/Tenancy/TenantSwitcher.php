/**
 * Moving a signed-in session from one of its user's tenants to another.
 *
 * tinvar-spec.md, "Identity across domains": "A session created on [a
 * custom domain] can only hold memberships within that domain's tenant
 * subtree, and the tenant switcher is limited to that subtree." And from
 * "Client-held data": what the client holds "is cleared, with a full page
 * load, on ... tenant switch".
 *
 * Two calls, for the application's own page and action -- which bring the
 * CSRF check, the session and the throttle a switch needs, as any action
 * does:
 *
 * - choices() lists where the signed-in user may go: the tenants they hold
 *   a membership of the panel in, at or below the tenant of the realm the
 *   request arrived on. On a custom domain, that is the domain's subtree;
 *   on a platform host naming no tenant, every tenant of theirs.
 * - switch() moves the session to one of them, held to the same rules
 *   again, and hands the application the switch (TenantSessions) -- which
 *   must answer with a new session id. A request's tenants, panels and
 *   tokens all follow from the session, so the next page is a new binding,
 *   and the client purges what it held for the old one.
 *
 * Every refusal is the same 403, `tenant_switch_refused`, so a caller
 * cannot tell a tenant that exists elsewhere from one that exists nowhere.
