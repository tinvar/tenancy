 * constrains: the session's tenant must be that tenant or a descendant",

 * membership". The framework asks; TenantHierarchy holds the answers to
 * limits that keep a mistake in them from widening anything.

 * Both answers come from one record -- a parent column, a path -- so they

 * implementation answering the two from different places could let a
 * parent read a tenant that is not its child.
